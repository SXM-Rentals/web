// WHAT THIS FILE DOES: Describes the shape of the information the app works
// with — what a car looks like, what a booking looks like, what a customer
// looks like. It doesn't hold any real data; it's the blueprint that keeps
// every screen agreeing on the same wording. When the real backend is built,
// it should return data in exactly these shapes.

// ---- PEOPLE ----

// SXM Rentals treats residents and visitors differently: they prove who they
// are with different documents, and residents can earn "Islander" status.
export type AccountType = 'local' | 'tourist';

// Where someone is in the identity-check process.
export type VerificationStatus = 'unstarted' | 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'resubmit';

// ---- RENTAL BUSINESSES ----

// PUBLIC information about a rental business — the things any customer is
// allowed to see. Everything on this type appears on the business's public page.
